This project represents an API for a social network. It consists of a MongoDB database and routes to create, read, update, and delete data from the database. Specifically, the database includes models for users and thoughts, with the thought model containing a subdocument for reactions. Users have a friends list, facilitating relationships with other users. In addition, thoughts and reactions reference users as owners, and users have a list of thoughts. full walk-through video linked above and the short gif below demonstrate the functionality of the API using Insomnia.
